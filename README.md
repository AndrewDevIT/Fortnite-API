Fortnite Status API

Hi,

You can get user wins, kills, the latest news, fortnite server status and many more with this API.

It's easy to install, just put the class.FortniteAPI.php in your directory and define the class. After that visit my documentation (https://fortniteapi.com/docs) and follow the steps.

Have fun!
